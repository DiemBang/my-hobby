          Hi there. I'm Diem and I recently moved back to Sweden after 13 years
          abroad living in London. My passion for travel was born during my time
          in the British capital. I would say it came soon after I moved there
          when I started working in the travel industry. After having been
          studying for basically my entire life and for the first time ever
          having a disposable income to spend on hobbies (and paid annual
          leave!), travels became a quality investment.<br /><br />
          During my years in London, which also makes a great outbound
          destination as there are plenty of good deals on flights worldwide, I
          was privileged to travel more or less every month, either for work or
          holiday. All my trips have brought me so much joy and created
          unforgettable memories that will last a lifetime. On this site you can
          find a map of where I have been travelling to and in the gallery I
          have compiled some photos from my favourite trips. Hope this will
          bring some inspiration for your next trip!
